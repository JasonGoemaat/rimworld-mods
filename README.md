# Goemaat Rimworld Mods

If making a new mod, update the `.gitignore` file.   It excludes everything
by default and has statements to only include certain folders/files to track
so it can be used in-place in the Rimworld mods folder and not affect other
mods that might be put there.

* Freezer Lamp - Like a normal standing lamp with a deep blue hue, but provides power instead of using it and provides a lot of passive cooling down to -15c, meant for freezers
